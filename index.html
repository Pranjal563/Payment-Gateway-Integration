            <p>Smiling face always looks good. Your little contribution will spread smiles on specially abled children's
                and person's faces. They will get all those things that they have rights after your one step. So many
                children can't listen clearly like us, can't speak fluently like us, can't run fast like us and can't do
                many more such activities like us. So please think once about it and come ahead for charity and
                humanity.</p>

            <p>When we interact with a physically challenged person, it does not mean that, he is also suffering from
                visual or hearing impairment. This thought process often stops us from interacting and communicating
                with such people. These disability barriers need to be torn down, which is only possible for more
                awareness. This awareness may come only when we help those people with disabilities. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-box about-box3">
            <p>Depression is the biggest dilemma people with disabilities face. Spend time with disabled people
                regularly and make them feel valued. They are humans, too, and they will feel better if they are not
                treated differently. You can hang out with them, shop with them, or watch a movie with them. While it
                takes more to support people with disabilities and sensory impairments, being around is a good start.
